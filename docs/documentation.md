# E-bureauet Website Starter Documentation

## About

E-bureauet Website Starter is a frontend foundation for web projects that is built on top of nodejs tools that brings several technologies to help in the development and build process of a frontend (static html site) development for a website project. It is designed to have the best practices and standards to provide robust static html site frontend builds that makes up the actual website that has an actual backend (cms, .net or php). This Website Starter is basically catered for E-bureauet frontend developers, but the backend team are also encouraged to learn how to use it.

## Why use the Website Starter

The Website Starter is not just a blank frontend template, but also a robust workflow for the developers that opens up access to efficient tools:

### GITHUB

We use Github for version control and source management. This is what makes collaborators push updates, pull changes, compare changes, merge changes from the local repository to the remote master repository.

### CSS Preprocessors

CSS Preprocessors are alternative stylesheet coding language (but it still accepts regular CSS syntax) that adds more power to the css writer in that it opens up functionalities like able to use variables, a more robust math calculations, nesting syntax (easier to read), and much more. We use SASS (short for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) as our CSS preprocessor.

### HTML Includes

Allows frontend developers to split a supposed html document into separate parts or partial html source files. This opens up a more modular approach in creating and maintaining html templates especially when there is a collaboration between frontend developers for one project instance.

### JS Modules

This is the same with the 'HTML Includes', where it allows developers to create one javascript file containing required .js files; they could be individual custom javascript files or javascript plugins/libraries. We use the tool Browserify to do this task.
